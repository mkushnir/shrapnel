TODO
====

Important
---------
- more docstrings
- Make sure _fastmath and friends are getting installed.
- Add simple_client?  See test_client.py.
- Go over every sentence in every spec to make sure this code adheres to it.
- Keys: Add debuging to keys.
- Diffie Hellman: When generating y, make sure that y > ln2(p)   (or y > 1024)
- Diffie Hellman: Reject insecure values of f (if g==2 and f has a single '1' bit, then they must have used a small y also)
- Diffie Hellman: Make sure generation of f is good (no single 1 bit)
- CORO: There are problems reading from stdin with coro.  test_coro_client doesn't work very well due to this fact.
- connect: I think there are some serious logic problems in the connect code.  In some places it manually calls process_messages waiting for a specifc response to a specific message.  However, this may cause it to miss other messages that are in the pipeline because there is no registry entry for them.  I think to fix the main problem is to change the core process_messages() in the connect class to permanently register its messages.
- finish Remote_To_Local_Forward
- Files in test directory are out of date and broken.
- Update with latest specs (need to see what has changed).

Should Do
---------
- Handle new key exchange (after every gigabyte or every hour)
- More unittests.
- DH Group Exchange
- formalize exceptions with arguments
- exception handling (bad packets, etc.)
- Stir the random pool (see ssh.util.random.py)
- Userauth: Add more debugging.
- Compression support.
- Document how to extend the various components of this library.
- Finish README high-level documentation.
- Test proactive stuff (both successful guess and failures)
- In the userauth module, inspect auths_that_can_continue when getting an authentication failure so that we don't try subsequent authentication methods that we know will not work.
- Figure out what partial_success means in the userauth module.
- Check for invalid channel id's in the connect.py code when looking at self.local_channels.
- Change module definition at top of file to be a triple quoted string instead of a comment.  This is the correct docstyle.
- Connect: No way to match channel requests with their response.  Need to check latest specs.

Would Be Nice
-------------
- Write a server
- I18N of error messages.
- Handle SSH1.x protocol.
- Userauth: Support pipelining (sending multiple userauth requests without waiting for the server to respond).
- Userauth: Mechanism to remember which auth method succeeds on a per-host basis.  Thus in future attempts to connect to the remote host, it can attempt the correct method first.
- BER: Make a complete ASN.1 decoder.
- BER: Break out the BER encodeder into a separate non-SSH specific module.
- BER: Add an encoder.
- Keys: Add key generator.
- Optimize...haven't yet done any performance testing.

Bugs
----
- Fix memory leaks (circular references)
