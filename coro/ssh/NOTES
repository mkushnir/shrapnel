        # if y < 1024, openssh will reject us: "bad server public DH value".
        # y<1024 means f will be short, and of the form 2^y, so an observer
        # could trivially derive our secret y from f. Openssh detects this
        # and complains, so avoid creating such values by requiring y to be
        # larger than ln2(self.p)

        # TODO: we should also look at the value they send to us and reject
        # insecure values of f (if g==2 and f has a single '1' bit while the
        # rest are '0's, then they must have used a small y also).

        # TODO: This could be computed when self.p is set up
        #  or do as openssh does and scan f for a single '1' bit instead
