This is a very simple demo using websockets to provide access to a
python prompt on a server via a browser.  The back door interface is
usually provided via a socket (usually a unix socket for security
reasons), but this approach will work in a pinch.  Back door
interfaces are invaluable during development/debugging.

I recommend this code be run over a 'wss' socket (i.e., websocket+TLS)
for obvious reasons.

The 'terminal' aspect of the javascript is rather clunky, and could
use some improvement - donations from javascript jockeys are
appreciated!

In the console/terminal:

  $ python term.py

In your browser, bring up 'term.html':

  https://localhost:9001/term.html

Note: you may want to use your own x509 cert rather than the test cert
distributed with Shrapnel.
